## Introduction

 In the depths of machine code, a knight's strategy is forged.
 Assembly of thought, Armor of logic

Hi there, welcome to the ***War of Assembly***, neva mind please there was just a cool name in my mind, So i hvae just used it.
This blog post will be about **"How you can write Hello world in Assembly"**. I know there are alot of resources out there, but
still I like to write about the stuff that I learn. So without any time waste lets begin...

### Epilogue
The world of computer system is very fascinating. It is more thrilling when you dive into the darkest corners of computer
systems. Same thing goes for assembly, because you are learning the art of talking to computer at the lower level, I guess n00bs
like me do have knowledge of programming languages such as C, C++, python or go so on and so forth. These are the lanaguages that
are a bit at high level it means you can understand it but computers doesn't know that shit you write like in C
```C
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
int main(){
    printf("This is high level lang\n");
    return 0;
}
```
or in python like...
```python
print("This is high level language")
```
instead the computer knows only about `0s` and `1s` but things in assembly level are different, it is the language that human can 
understand as well as computer systems do at some point. The other difference is, in other high languages you write a program of your
own choice and that language will do it for you from building the program, to compiling it and it will run it for you, but in assembly
you have control on everything, like assembling the program using assembler then linking it manually using the linker. You can refert to 
the below image.

Assembly language consists of instructions which are called `menemonics` and some `operands` on which you are performing some sort of operations like
`add`, `sub`, `imul`, `mov` so on and so forth.
We won't have some sort of advance assembly programming cuz I am a little bit n00b like you, I am learning too, so neva mind ;). In future I will
write some more blog posts related to assembly.
